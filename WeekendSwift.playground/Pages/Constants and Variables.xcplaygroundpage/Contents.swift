/*:
These problems cover the basic essentials of Swift syntax. Hopefully you can use these exercises to help identify your weak areas. I would encourage you to take this information and play around on the pages you struggle the most on to solidify those concepts.

Each page will have an assortment of challenges that increase with difficulty as they continue. Solutions will be provided on the next page.

/*:
*Challenge*: Create/modify the following variables/constants.
### Constants:

1. an explicitly declared `Int` named `buzz` with a value of `5`
1. a `Bool` named `stretch` with a value of `true`
1. a `Double` named `hamm` with a value of 1.618
1. an `Int` named `mrPotato` converted from the `String` `rex`
1. a `Float` named `boPeep` with a value of `3.14`
1. an optional `Double` named `slinky` with a value of 4.2
1. an optional `Double` named `hannah` with no value
