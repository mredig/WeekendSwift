//: ## Challenge
//:
//: You're a jedi! (Star Wars is cool too! (Okay, *was* cool...)) As you begin your life as a jedi, you won't have a lightsaber, therefore you won't have a lightsaber color. But, once you get to the point in your training where you get a lightsaber, it will, of course, have a color.
//: Create an optional string called "lightsaberColor". You can give it a value or nil


//: Use `if let` to create a conditional where you will print out "My lightsaber color is \(_)!" using the value of `lightsaberColor`. If `lightsaberColor` is nil, have it print out "I still need to train before I get a lightsaber."



//: Change the lightsaber color to be nil if you have one, or set one if you're using nil. How does the output change?
